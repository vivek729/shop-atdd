# Reports what would be cleaned up for a rehearsal — and prints the
# exact commands you can copy-paste to actually delete it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/atdd-rehearsal-end.sh <name>              # one rehearsal, print only
#   scripts/atdd-rehearsal-end.sh <name> --execute    # one rehearsal, actually delete
#   scripts/atdd-rehearsal-end.sh --all               # every rehearsal, print only
#   scripts/atdd-rehearsal-end.sh --all --execute     # every rehearsal, actually delete
#
# Default behavior is print-only: cleanup is destructive (force-removing
# worktrees, force-deleting branches along with any commits on them), so
# deletion requires the explicit --execute flag.
