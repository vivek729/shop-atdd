# Spins up a throwaway git worktree for rehearsing an ATDD run.
#
# Usage: scripts/atdd-rehearsal-start.sh <name>
#
# Example: scripts/atdd-rehearsal-start.sh demo1
#   creates a sibling directory `../rehearsal-demo1`
#   on a fresh branch `rehearsal/demo1` based on the current HEAD.
#
# Multiple rehearsals can coexist — pick a unique <name> for each one.
# Run `git worktree list` to see what's currently checked out.
# When you're done with a rehearsal, run:
#   scripts/atdd-rehearsal-end.sh <name>
#
# Note: only committed state from your current branch is carried into
# the rehearsal. Uncommitted changes in your working tree are NOT copied.
