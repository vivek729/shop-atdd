# 2026-06-24 12:03 UTC — Compile the component **and all its test sources** up front, ideally via `gh optivem`

## TL;DR

**Why:** The commit-stage `Compile Code` step compiles main + the **unit** test source only.
In backend-java the `integrationTest` / `componentTest` source sets are **not** compiled up
front — they compile lazily when their suite task runs, so a *compilation* error in
component/integration test code surfaces mid-suite (after the slow Docker spin-up) instead of
in `Compile Code`. Separately, compilation is still a **raw per-language command** baked into
each workflow's YAML, unlike test execution which plan 0916 routed through
`gh optivem component test run --suite` with `component-tests.yaml` as the single source of
truth. Two gaps: a **fail-fast coverage gap** (mostly Java) and a **single-source-of-truth
gap** (all three languages).

**End result:** Every commit-stage `run` job compiles **all** of a component's production +
test sources *before* the gating suites, failing fast on any compile error ahead of the Docker
suites — and (if Option B) it does so via a single `gh optivem component test compile` verb
reading the compile command from each `component-tests.yaml`, uniform across Java/.NET/TS, so
the suite/compile command mapping has one home.

## Problem

Plan 0916 moved suite **execution** into the gating `run` job via the CLI. Compilation was left
as-is — a raw build-tool call per language:

| Workflow | `Compile Code` today | Compiles test sources? |
|---|---|---|
| `*-java` (monolith + backend) | `./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava` | **unit only** — `integrationTest`/`componentTest` source sets compile lazily at suite time (build.gradle:31–46) |
| `*-dotnet` | `dotnet build` | whole solution incl. test projects → **likely all** (verify the `.slnx` includes the component/contract test projects) |
| `*-typescript` | `npm run build` (`tsc`) | src only? test files may be type-checked only at test time → **verify per tsconfig** |
| `frontend-react` | (verify) | (verify) |

Consequences:
- **Slow feedback on a test-compile error (Java):** a typo in a `componentTest` class is not
  caught by `Compile Code`; it fails during `Run Component Tests`, after Testcontainers/WireMock
  startup. Fail-fast is lost for exactly the slowest suites.
- **No single source of truth for compilation:** the compile command is duplicated/forked across
  7 workflows and 3 languages, drifting independently of `component-tests.yaml`.

## Goal

1. **Coverage:** `Compile Code` (or a new compile step) compiles **every** source set/project a
   component's suites need, so all compile errors surface before any suite runs.
2. **(Option B) Single source of truth:** the compile command lives in `component-tests.yaml`
   and is invoked via `gh optivem component test compile [--component <c>]`, mirroring
   `setup` / `run`.

## Options considered

**Option A — widen the raw gradle/tsc step (per workflow, no CLI change).**
- Java: `./gradlew testClasses integrationTestClasses componentTestClasses` (compiles main +
  all three test source sets) in `Compile Code`.
- TS: ensure `npm run build` (or an added `tsc --noEmit` over the test tsconfig) covers test
  files.
- .NET: confirm `dotnet build` already covers the test projects (probably a no-op).
- *Pro:* tiny, immediate, no CLI work. *Con:* language-specific strings re-duplicated in YAML;
  no single source of truth; drifts from `component-tests.yaml`.

**Option B — CLI owns compile (single source of truth).**
- Add a `compileCommands:` (list) or `buildCommand:` field to each `component-tests.yaml`, and a
  `gh optivem component test compile` verb that runs it per selected component (sibling to
  `RunSetup`).
- Workflows replace the raw `Compile Code` body with
  `gh optivem component test compile --component <c>` (monolith: no `--component`).
- *Pro:* uniform across languages, one home for the compile command, matches the 0916
  philosophy. *Con:* a `gh-optivem` repo change + release before the workflows can use it.

**Option B is the better long-term fit; Option A is the quick fail-fast win.** A viable path is
**A first** (close the Java coverage gap now) then **B** (fold compile into the CLI) — but doing
both means touching each workflow twice. See OQ4 (coordination with the 0916 wave).

## Steps

### Phase 0 — Decide & verify reality (do first)
- [ ] Resolve **OQ1–OQ4**.
- [ ] Verify the per-language coverage claims: does `dotnet build` compile the component/contract
  test projects (inspect `MyCompany.MyShop.Backend.slnx`)? does the TS `npm run build` /
  tsconfig include the component/integration test files? Record findings in this plan.

### Phase 1 — Coverage (Option A, or the A-part of A→B)
- [ ] **Java (all 4 java commit stages):** widen `Compile Code` to compile every test source set
  (`./gradlew compileJava compileTestJava compileIntegrationTestJava compileComponentTestJava`,
  or the `*Classes` task form). `actionlint` each.
- [ ] **TS / .NET:** add the minimal compile coverage only where Phase 0 proved a gap.

### Phase 2 — (Option B, only if chosen) CLI compile verb
- [ ] `gh-optivem`: add the `component-tests.yaml` compile field + `component test compile` verb
  + tests (mirror `RunSetup` in `internal/build/componenttest/run.go`). Cut a release.
- [ ] Populate `compileCommands` in all 7 `component-tests.yaml`.
- [ ] Replace each workflow's raw `Compile Code` body with the CLI call.

### Phase 3 — Verify
- [ ] `actionlint` every changed workflow; one green CI run per workflow (Docker suites can't be
  verified locally — [[project_local_testcontainers_blocked]]).

## Decisions
1. **Compilation must fail fast before the gating suites** — all test sources compile in (or
   before) the gating block, ahead of the slow Docker suites.

## Open questions
- **OQ1 — Option A, B, or A→B?** *Recommend:* **A→B** — close the Java coverage gap immediately
  (Option A), then route compile through the CLI (Option B) so it shares one home with the
  suites. Accept touching each workflow's compile step twice, *unless* OQ4 bundles B into the
  0916 wave (then it's once).
- **OQ2 — (if B) config shape.** A dedicated `compileCommands:` list + a `compile` verb, or fold
  the compile command into the existing suite-agnostic `setupCommands`? *Recommend:* a dedicated
  `compileCommands` + `compile` verb — `setup` is harness prep (pre-warm), compile is a distinct
  phase; keeping them separate mirrors mainstream lifecycle CLIs (the same rationale `run` vs
  `setup` already follow).
- **OQ3 — Java task form.** `compile*Java` tasks vs `*Classes` tasks (the latter also process
  resources)? *Recommend:* `*Classes` (matches what the suite tasks actually depend on).
- **OQ4 — Coordinate with plan 0916's propagation wave.** 0916 Phase 2 still edits the same 7
  workflows' compile/test region. *Recommend:* **decide OQ1 before the 0916 wave runs** so each
  workflow is edited once — if Option B is chosen, land the CLI verb first, then the 0916 wave
  applies the gating steps *and* the CLI compile call together. [[feedback_plan_over_parallel_tickets]]
- **OQ5 — `frontend-react`.** Confirm whether the frontend even has a separable compile step and
  test-source coverage gap; it may be out of scope.

## Risks
- **CLI release coupling (Option B):** workflows can't adopt the compile verb until a gh-optivem
  release ships it — sequence the release ahead of the workflow edits.
- **Double-edit churn:** doing A then B touches each workflow's compile step twice unless folded
  into the 0916 wave (OQ4).
- **Over-compiling:** widening Java compile adds a little wall-clock, but it's strictly cheaper
  than discovering the same error after Testcontainers startup.

## ▶ Next executable step (resume here)

This plan is **draft, awaiting refinement** — the next move is a `/refine-plan` pass to resolve
**OQ1–OQ5** (especially OQ1 A/B/A→B and OQ4 coordination with plan 0916's wave), then verify the
Phase 0 per-language reality. Do **not** start editing workflows until OQ1 + OQ4 are settled, so
the 7 commit-stage workflows are edited the minimum number of times. Related:
