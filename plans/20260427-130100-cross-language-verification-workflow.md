# Plan — Cross-Language System Verification Workflow

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Status:** Phase 1 ✅ + Phase 2 ✅ + Phase 3 (legacy folded inline) ✅ — all verified in CI; plan kept as historical record
**Owner:** unassigned

## Goal

A single workflow that verifies behavior parity across system languages: each test-lang's suite is run against every other system-lang's SUT (Java tests vs .NET system, .NET tests vs TypeScript system, etc.). Same-lang-vs-same-system combos are skipped — those are already covered by the per-(arch, lang) acceptance stages.

This is purely a **regression check**. It does NOT tag images, publish git tags, or trigger downstream prerelease pipelines. Failures surface backend-behavior drift (the "identical backend behavior" contract from the project rules) but do not block any release.

## Why it goes here, not in gh-optivem or per-lang stages

- **Not in `gh-optivem/_gh-acceptance-pipeline.yml`** — that matrix tests the gh-optivem CLI's scaffolding ability, not shop's runtime behavior parity. Different concern.
- **Not in per-(arch, lang) acceptance stages** — those produce per-artifact RC tags. Adding cross-lang verification to each stage would (a) get template-copy-pasted across 6 workflows, (b) couple "Java RC release" to "all 3 backends green" — wrong, since a flaky .NET image should not block a Java release.
- **One standalone workflow** — runs on its own cadence, fails loud, blocks nothing.

## Out of scope (for Phase 1 / Phase 2)

- `tests-legacy.json` cross-lang verification. **Not dropped — deferred to Phase 3** as a standalone workflow rather than co-mounted in this matrix. Rationale: legacy tests pin to specific historical module versions, so the failure modes (version-pin drift vs cross-lang behavior drift) are different in kind from latest. Mixing them in one matrix would muddy the signal and double wall time before we even know if the latest matrix is stable. See Phase 3 below.
- Fixing the SHA-pinning gap in pipeline compose files. Tracked separately in [20260427-130000-fix-deploy-sha-pinning.md](20260427-130000-fix-deploy-sha-pinning.md). Phase 2 of this plan depends on that being done.
- Test code base-URL parameterization. The cross-lang matrix maps each system-lang to its own port set (java=31xx, dotnet=32xx, ts=33xx). If `system-test/<test-lang>/` test code hardcodes one port set in its config, those tests will hit "wrong" ports when pointed at a different system-lang. Likely needs base-URL injection via env var. **Defer until Phase 1 dry run reveals whether this is actually broken** — possible the test runner already reads URLs from `system.json` via the gh-optivem runner.

## Phase 1 — ship build-from-source workflow (mostly done)

**File:** [shop/.github/workflows/cross-lang-system-verification.yml](../.github/workflows/cross-lang-system-verification.yml)

**What it does:**
- Matrix: `arch × test-lang × system-lang` (2 × 3 × 3 = 18) minus 3 same-lang exclude rules (each spans both archs, so 6 entries) = **12 combos**
- Daily cron at 06:00 UTC, off-peak from per-lang stages
- `workflow_dispatch` with optional `commit-sha` (atomically pins source + compose + tests + system.json)
- Builds SUT from source via `gh optivem build system` against `docker/<system-lang>/<arch>/system.json` (which references `docker-compose.local.real.yml` — has `build:` directives, no GHCR pull)
- Runs full `tests-latest.json` from the test-lang's `system-test/` directory via `gh optivem test system`
- Stops SUT in `if: always()` finalizer

**Tradeoff vs pre-built images:**
- ✅ No GHCR coupling, no auth, no preflight, no digest resolution — clean isolation
- ✅ Atomically SHA-pinned via `checkout @ <sha>` (stricter than per-lang stages today)
- ❌ Rebuilds 3 systems (Java/Maven, .NET/dotnet, Node/npm) from scratch on every run, ~5–15 min per matrix entry overhead
- ❌ Tests fresh source build, not the artifact that will actually be released

**Items remaining for Phase 1:** _(none — Phase 1 complete pending verification CI run)_

## Phase 2 — switch to pre-built images

**Status (2026-04-28):** unblocked. The SHA-pinning prerequisite landed in `b638b6a5` — `deploy-docker-compose` honors the resolved digest and pipeline compose files accept `${SYSTEM_IMAGE:-…}`. Phase 2 can begin.

The cross-lang workflow should refactor to **pull pre-built `sha-<sha>` images** instead of building from source. This:

- ✅ Saves ~5–15 min per matrix entry (no rebuild)
- ✅ Tests the actual artifact that will be released, not a parallel source build
- ✅ Reuses the now-correct SHA-pinning machinery

**Refactor steps:** _(none — Phase 2 complete pending verification CI run)_

**Decisions made during Phase 2 implementation:**
- **Preflight `check-ghcr-packages-exist` deliberately omitted.** Cross-lang is intended to be invoked from `meta-prerelease-stage.yml` after per-(arch, lang) commit + acceptance stages have already produced the images. Missing images are a real error, not a "skip" condition — failing hard surfaces orchestration bugs immediately. Aligns with the project rule "GitHub Actions — `check-*` actions must NOT swallow errors": a `false` `exists` output would conflate "absent" with "couldn't tell" and bury misconfiguration.
- **Test execution uses `gh optivem test system --no-build --no-start`.** SUT lifecycle is owned by `deploy-docker-compose`; the runner just executes `setupCommands` + suites from `tests-latest.json`. Confirmed safe in [tests.go prepareSystem](../../gh-optivem/internal/runner/tests.go) — when `--no-start` is set, the runner probes `system.json` URLs to verify the system is up, then runs tests.

**Risk specific to Phase 2:**
- Cross-lang testing pre-built images means failures could indicate (a) genuine cross-lang behavior drift OR (b) drift between source HEAD and the published image. Minor confusion, manageable via good error messaging in the test summary.

**Meta-prerelease integration (done with Phase 2):** cross-lang is invoked from `_meta-prerelease-pipeline.yml` as a sibling job to the per-flavor `pipeline` matrix. Both gate on `commit` (which publishes the `sha-<sha>` images cross-lang pulls). Cross-lang is gated on `variant == 'all'` AND `level in ['acceptance','qa']` AND `!skip-tests` — single-variant runs only publish one SUT image set, so other matrix entries would 404 on digest resolution. Cross-lang failure cascades up: pipeline workflow → `run` job in stage → blocks `tag-meta-rc`. Pinned to `commit-sha: ${{ github.sha }}` so workflow files / system.json / tests config match the commit being verified.

## Phase 3 — legacy cross-lang verification (folded inline)

**Decision (2026-04-28):** legacy cross-lang runs in the **same matrix entry as latest**, sequentially, against the **same SUT**. Each matrix entry now runs `tests-latest.json` then `tests-legacy.json` against one deployed SUT. The original design (separate workflow file + separate cron) was rejected in favor of operational simplicity:

- ✅ Reuses the SUT — no second deploy cost (~3 min saved per matrix entry).
- ✅ Single workflow run shows both signals; one cron, one summary, one place to look.
- ✅ Same orchestration via meta-prerelease — legacy gates `tag-meta-rc` automatically.
- ❌ Doubles wall time per matrix entry (~11 min → ~22 min). Acceptable: still well below the per-flavor pipeline's wall time, so no impact on `tag-meta-rc` latency.
- ❌ A flaky legacy suite shows up as a red matrix entry, even if latest passed. Mitigation: `if: always()` on the legacy step so both signals always report independently in the job log.

**Implementation:** added `Run ${{ matrix.test-lang }} legacy system tests vs ${{ matrix.system-lang }} SUT` step after the latest step in [cross-lang-system-verification.yml](../.github/workflows/cross-lang-system-verification.yml). Same `gh optivem test system --no-build --no-start` invocation, just `--test-config system-test/${{ matrix.test-lang }}/tests-legacy.json`.

**Open questions answered:**
- *Is legacy cross-lang parity a meaningful signal?* — In practice, yes for the same reasons as latest. Whether failures dominate as (a) genuine drift or (b) version-pin artifacts will become clear from a few real CI runs.
- *Cadence?* — Same as latest (daily cron + meta-prerelease invocation). Folded inline, so no separate scheduling.
- *Build-from-source vs pull-from-GHCR?* — Pull-from-GHCR (Phase 2 mechanism). Legacy tests target the same SUT images as latest; the test framework's `tests-legacy.json` pins to historical *module* versions internally, not infrastructure SHAs.

## Cron cadence

Phase 1 schedule: **daily at 06:00 UTC**. Rationale:
- Per-lang acceptance is hourly. Cross-lang is more expensive (12 combos vs 1) and lower-stakes (regression detection, not release gating).
- Daily is enough to catch drift within ~24h of introduction.
- Off-peak avoids contention with the hourly per-lang fleet.

If Phase 2 reduces wall time significantly (no rebuild), revisit cadence — could go to every-N-hours.

## Verification

End state: **one full workflow run completes with all 12 combos either green or with a clearly-categorized failure** (genuine drift / port mismatch / infra flake).

**Achieved:**
- Phase 1 verified in run [25037183700](https://github.com/optivem/shop/actions/runs/25037183700) — 12/12 green, ~11.5 min wall time (build-from-source).
- Phase 2 verified in run [25040305391](https://github.com/optivem/shop/actions/runs/25040305391) — 12/12 green, ~11 min wall time (pre-built images; the predicted 5–15 min/entry savings did not materialize because gradle/dotnet/playwright runtime dominates over docker build time).
- Phase 3 (legacy folded inline) verified in run [25040988575](https://github.com/optivem/shop/actions/runs/25040988575) — 12/12 green, ~20.5 min wall time (latest + legacy sequentially per matrix entry, ~2× Phase 2 as predicted).
