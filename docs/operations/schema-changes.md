# Schema changes

How to change the shop database schema safely.

The shop has a single canonical schema in `system/db/migrations/`, applied to every Postgres instance by the `db-migrate` Flyway sidecar before any app starts. All six SUT implementations (3 languages × 2 architectures) are pure schema consumers — none of them create, drop, or alter tables on boot.

Every schema change is a new SQL migration file. Read this whole document before opening a PR that touches `system/db/migrations/`.

## 1. Forward-only doctrine

No `U__*.sql` undo files. The Flyway undo feature is treated as if it doesn't exist. The sidecar runs with `FLYWAY_CLEAN_DISABLED=true` so a misconfigured CI step cannot wipe a schema.

**Recovery from a bad migration is a new forward migration, never a reversal.** If `V20260601120000__add_email.sql` was wrong, the fix is `V20260601153000__drop_email.sql` or `V20260601153000__fix_email.sql`. Don't edit the original file once it has run anywhere — Flyway stores its checksum in `flyway_schema_history` and will refuse to run again with a mismatch.

Why forward-only:

- A down migration that drops a column also deletes the data the previous app version wrote there. There is no `reverse(ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN x)` that brings the data back.
- Forward-only forces every migration to be safe-by-construction at write time, when you still have the context, rather than relying on a hypothetical reversal step at incident time.
- Tools that offer undo (Flyway undo, EF Core `Down()`, ActiveRecord `down`) are footguns in any environment with real data. The Postgres community has been clear about this for years.

## 2. App rollback ≠ schema rollback

Apps roll back via the platform — `kubectl rollout undo`, `docker compose up` with the previous image, blue/green flip. Seconds, no data risk.

The schema does not roll back. The previous app version runs against the current schema by design.

This only works if every migration preserves the previous app version's invariants. The table below summarises the common change types.

| Change type        | Wrong (couples to one app version)             | Right (rollback-safe)                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add column         | `ADD COLUMN x NOT NULL` (old code can't write) | `ADD COLUMN x DEFAULT 0` (old code keeps working)                      |
| Rename column      | `RENAME COLUMN a TO b` (old code can't find a) | Add `b` → dual-write → migrate readers → drop `a` (multi-step)         |
| Drop column        | `DROP COLUMN a` (old code still reads a)       | Stop writing → wait → stop reading → drop (multi-step)                 |
| Tighten constraint | `ALTER … SET NOT NULL` (old code writes NULL)  | Add tolerant default → backfill → tighten                              |

The right-hand column is the **expand-contract pattern**: every change is split into safe steps that each leave both the previous and the new app version functional.

## 3. Expand-contract worked examples

### Renaming a column (`old_name` → `new_name`)

1. **Expand.** Add `new_name` alongside `old_name`. Both nullable, no constraints yet.
2. **Dual-write.** Update the app to write to both columns. Deploy.
3. **Backfill.** Migration that copies `old_name` → `new_name` for existing rows.
4. **Migrate readers.** Update the app to read from `new_name`. Deploy.
5. **Stop writing the old name.** Update the app to stop writing `old_name`. Deploy.
6. **Contract.** Drop `old_name`.

Five or six migrations across multiple deploys. Every intermediate state is rollback-safe.

### Dropping a column

1. **Stop writing it.** Deploy.
2. **Wait.** Confirm no traffic still depends on it (logs, metrics, retention window for in-flight requests).
3. **Stop reading it.** Deploy.
4. **Contract.** Drop the column.

### Tightening a constraint (`NULL`-able → `NOT NULL`)

1. **Add a tolerant default.** `ALTER COLUMN … SET DEFAULT …` so new writes can't insert NULL.
2. **Backfill.** Update any existing NULL rows to the default value.
3. **Contract.** `ALTER COLUMN … SET NOT NULL`.

## 4. PR checklist

Before merging a PR that touches `system/db/migrations/`:

- [ ] One new SQL file per logical migration, named `V{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}__{description}.sql`.
- [ ] The migration preserves the previous app version's invariants (see the rollback-safety table above), or is part of a documented expand-contract sequence.
- [ ] The migration does not edit a previously released migration file (checksums are forever).
- [ ] If renaming a column or table, you are doing it in expand-contract steps and not all at once.
- [ ] Local verification: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up` from at least one of the six stack/mode pairings boots cleanly and `flyway_schema_history` shows `success=t` for the new entry.

## 5. Open work

- **Previous-version smoke test** is not yet implemented. The shop has no production deploys today, so rolling-deploy safety is theoretical. When shop adopts release tagging for deploys, add a CI job that runs the previous release's image against the current migration set. Until then, rollback-safety is enforced by review against the table above.
