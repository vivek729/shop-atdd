/**
 * Low-level ERP stub driver: registers WireMock mappings against a supplied {@link WireMock} client.
 * Wrapping a client (rather than a {@code WireMockServer}) lets one driver type point at either the
 * in-process component-test server or the in-process narrow-integration server. The URLs and JSON
 * bodies are byte-identical to {@code AbstractComponentTest}'s {@code stub*} helpers, so switching a
 * test to the DSL is behaviour-neutral.
