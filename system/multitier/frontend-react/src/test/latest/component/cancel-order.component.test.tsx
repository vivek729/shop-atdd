// Maintainable contract spec (component level) for CANCEL ORDER — the frontend twin of the system
// test's latest/acceptance/CancelOrder{Positive,Negative}Test.
//
// Cancelling has no screen of its own: the user opens an order and presses the action there, so
// each spec stages the order it opens AND the cancel it presses. What the frontend depends on is
// only the STATUS CODE — the backend answers 204 with no body — plus, when refused, the reason it
// has to put on the screen.
//
// The already-cancelled rejection from the acceptance suite has no twin here: the Cancel button is
// hidden for a CANCELLED order (view-order.component.test.tsx pins that), so a user cannot provoke
// it. The blackout is the one cancel rejection the UI can reach, and therefore the one it renders.
