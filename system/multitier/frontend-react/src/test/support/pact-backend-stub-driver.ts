// Pact-backed Backend Stub Driver — the "latest" test-kit's low-level plumbing.
//
// It absorbs the raw PactV3 ceremony (construction, addInteraction, and the
// executeTest mock-server lifecycle) so the Backend Stub DSL and the specs above
// it never touch Pact directly. The pact is written into the canonical contracts/
// dir, resolved from the package root via process.cwd() — so a spec's folder depth
// (component/latest, integration/legacy, …) is irrelevant; every consumer spec
// merges idempotently into the one frontend-backend.json.
//
// PactV3 is callback-shaped: executeTest(cb) boots the mock server, runs cb, then
// verifies that every staged interaction was actually exercised. Left as-is, that
// callback has to wrap the spec body — which is exactly the plumbing a spec should
// never see. This driver inverts it: backendUrl() starts executeTest lazily and
// parks inside the callback on a deferred, handing the spec just a URL; finish()
// releases the deferred at teardown and awaits the run, so Pact's verification
// failure still fails the owning test.
